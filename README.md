Lines 10 is a casual puzzle game based on the original Lines made for Windows 98 (hence the number 10 - Windows 10).

The game has no victory condition, and could go on endlessly. Players score points by moving balls on a 9x9 grid. At the end of each turn, if 5 or more matching-colored balls are arranged in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line, these balls are cleared and players score points for each matching ball. On the other hand, if an action does not result in a match, up to 3 new balls may spawn in random positions across the board, with their color and location displayed the turn before. Balls cannot move diagonally, and depending on the placement of other balls may be blocked from reaching certain positions. The game ends when the player can no longer make any valid moves, or make any move without filling up the entire board.

Features:
- Purely mouse-based gameplay.
- Hover-and-Inspect: Hover on a cell to get its coordinates, and any information on what's on there, or whether or not a ball can navigate to that location.
- Pause and Restart Buttons.
- Timer, score and ball queue.
- Left-mouse to select and deselect balls, or move a selected ball to a new position if applicable.

Special balls:
- Ghost ball: Has a transparent color shade. May pass through other balls, and can reach positions that normally would block a normal ball.
- Bomb: Pitch black. Move to a new position to detonate, blowing up all balls (both queued and active) in a 3x3 area, and forcing new balls to spawn.
- Double ball: Identifiable by a checkerboard pattern. A double ball counts as 2 balls for any line that matches its color.
- Wildcard: Hard to ignore with its rainbow coat. Can be used in place of any color in a line; however, it cannot be used to complete a line by itself.
